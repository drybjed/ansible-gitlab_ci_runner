  synopsis: |
    [GitLab CI Runner](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci-runner/) is
    a helper Ruby program which is used by
    [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) service to run continuous
    integration tests. It should be installed on a separate host (or multiple
    hosts) or even in a LXC or OpenVZ container and is designed to be easily
    reinstalled if necessary. You will need a GitLab CI instance to use
    Runners, which can be installed and configured using `debops.gitlab_ci`
    role.
